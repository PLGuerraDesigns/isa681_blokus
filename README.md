# ISA 681 Final Project

## Charles Tucker & Pablo L. Guerra

A real-time Blokus game built with [Flutter](https://flutter.dev/), [Flame](https://flame-engine.org/) and [Supabase](https://supabase.com).

## This project has several known issues and is not a finished product.

It is a proof of concept for a real-time multiplayer game using Supabase as the backend and Flame as the game engine.
The game is playable, but several issues need to be addressed before it can be considered a finished product.
We are not actively working on this project at this time and have released it as a proof of concept and learning experience for others to build upon.
